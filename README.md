# About me
Hi, I am Tina Michl, a graphic designer, currently living in Munich. I worked as a designer for 8 years and afterwards as a career changer in a zero waste shop. I did a further education in frontend development a few years ago and have experience with html / css. Since April 2023 I am taking part at the Web Development course at Neue Fische bootcamp to deepen my frontend knowledge and learn JavaScript.
